#Determining Body Mass Index (BMI) 

#Following is a chart for determining oneâ€™s body mass index (BMI). BMI is a general  indication of the amount of body fat that a person has. The formula for computing BMI  is,  
#BMI = mass / height2 
#Implement a Python program that prompts a user for their height and weight. Height  should be entered as inches and weight should be entered in pounds. Perform the  calculation in units of kilograms and meters as shown in the chart. Compare the result to  the information in the chart. Use class(es) in your program design. 


class BMI:

    print("Welcome to my BMI calculator!")
    print("If you can tell me your weight and height")
    print("I can tell you your Body Mass Index")
    print("Thank You!\n")

    Inches = float(input("Please enter your height in inches: "))
    Pounds = float(input("Please enter your weight in pounds: "))
    get_height = Inches * 0.0254
    get_weight = Pounds / 2.2


    def BMI(get_height, get_weight):
        body_mass_index = round(get_weight/ (get_height ** 2), 1) 

        return body_mass_index

    body_mass_index = BMI(get_height, get_weight)
    print("\nYour BMI is", format(body_mass_index), end='')

    if body_mass_index <= 18.5:
        print(', it means you are underweight.')

    elif body_mass_index > 18.5 and body_mass_index < 25:
        print(', it means you are normal.')

    elif body_mass_index >25 and body_mass_index <30:
        print(', it means you are overweight.')

    elif body_mass_index > 30:
        print(', it means you are obese.')

    else:
        print('THERE IS AN ERROR OF YOUR INPUT.')
